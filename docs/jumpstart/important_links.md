## Weekly Catch-Up Code

The weekly catch-up code will be provided in git tags. You should be able to view
the tags by typing `git tag -l` or going to GitHub, clicking on the "master" dropdown,
and selecting the "tags" tab.

It will probably be easiest to look at it on github, so just use the starter code
links above to get to the pages, and look at the tag for the week you're interested
in.

>Note: the tags are listed as a week later than when the material is taught.
>For example, the catch-up code for week 6 will be listed as 'week-7-...', where
>the '...' represent the name of the workshop.
