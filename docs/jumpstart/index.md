# Jumpstart Weekly Lesson Plans

Hey there!


Here is where you'll find all of the lesson pans we'll base our weekly workshops
off of. If you miss a week or prefer text-based formats to slides or videos, this
is what you'll want to use. 

This tab is organized with each week separated into a different page, which you
should see on the left.

As always, if you have questions, please reach out to us in our Slack workspace
(using the #jumpstart-help channel). We'll be sure to get back to you as fast
as we can.

>If there's anything in here you want to change, you can do that with the pencil icon
at the top right of the page. That will take you to an editor where you can make the
changes you'd like to see on our learn pages. At the bottom of the page, you'll be
able to make a comment letting us know what changes you made (the top text box), and 
you'll be able to make a new branch (feel free to name it something related to the 
change you're making). Once you do that, click `Commit changes` and we'll work with
you to implement the changes.
