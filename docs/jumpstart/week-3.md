# Introduction to Javascript

## Javascript

Javascript allows you to add interactivity and complex functionality to your website. Javascript started as a simple scripting language designed to complete simple tasks on a webpage. Now we have Javascript frameworks like React that dominate modern web development. We'll see a lot more Javascript as we start working with React but for now we will stick to simple use cases.

Javascript is fairly intuitive to pick up if you're familiar with Python or a different scripting language but can be tricky if you don't have much general coding experience.

### Where can you write Javascript

Javascript is fully integrated with HTML and CSS and comes built into any web browser. You can run Javascript through the developer console of your web browser.

- On Chrome: Options > More tools > Developer tools

- On Firefox:

- On Safari:

### Topics

- Data Types

Numbers, Strings, objects, arrays, null, undefined

- Variables

`var` is the default and used to be the only way to declare a variable. 
In newer versions of Javascript you should use `let` when your variable may change and `const` when it will never have to change.

- ifs/else/for

`if (condition) { path1 } else { path2 }` for controlling flow.

`for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { some_repeating_condition }`
`for (let item in array) { some_repeating_condition }` 

- Functions
    - Anonymous syntax
    
`function func_name(arg1, arg2) { function_code }`
`const func_name = (arg1, arg2) => { function_code }`
