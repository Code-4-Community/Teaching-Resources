# Jumpstart Full-Stack Development Course

Jumpstart is Code4Community's new program that focuses on teaching the basics of web development for beginners. We have planned a 10-week course that runs through a lot of the fundamentals you'll want to know for developing a web application. Through the program's project, you will be learning technologies like React, Typescript, Vertx, and Java. A basic understanding of programming is required (Java recommended), and you'll learn everything else you need from our weekly workshops!
