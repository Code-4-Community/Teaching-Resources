# Jumpstart Full-Stack Development Course

Jumpstart is Code4Community's new program that focuses on teaching the basics of web development for beginners. 
We have planned a 10-week course that runs through a lot of the fundamentals you'll want to know for developing a 
web application. Through the project you have the option of building, you will be 
learning technologies like React, Typescript, Vertx, and Java. A basic understanding 
of programming is required (Java recommended, but you can try out 
[Codecademy courses](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) if you're new), and you'll learn 
everything else you need from our weekly workshops!

The structure of these docs is as follows:

- The Homepage 
    - This page!
- Jumpstart Lesson Plans
    - Contains all of the lesson plans for Jumpstart, as well as our dictionary and 
    a list of important links .
- Guides

- Workshops (2019)
    -  Some workshops we put on last year! It has some cool guides we created
    on Git, Vue.js (a React competitor), and backend development with APIs.
