## Jumpstart Overview

First, we'll be going over the general plan we have for Jumpstart over the next few months.

### What is Jumpstart?

From [our website](https://c4cneu.com/jumpstart).

>Jumpstart is Code4Community's new program that focuses on teaching the basics of web 
>development to beginners. 

Over the next couple of weeks (we have 9-10 sessions planned including this one), we'll 
be going through a lot of the fundamentals you'll need to know for developing an interactive 
web application. Our aim is to help you understand and have the tools for developing a
personal project of your own in the future.

### Who is this program for?

This program is honestly for anyone interested in software development or interested in the
inner workings of a basic web application. Non-computer science majors are welcome! While a 
background in computer programming is recommended, as long as you complete the recommended 
preparation down below, you'll probably be well prepared for this course. We'll also be here 
with dedicated tutors monitoring a special Slack channel and weekly office hours if you have
any questions, no matter how silly they may seem.

### How should I prepare?

To prepare you for this course, we're recommending you take the [Java Codecademy 
course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java). The free course is more than enough to
teach the understanding of Java we're expecting you to have. If you already know Java, then you'll
probably be fine without taking it, but for anyone who feels they could benefit from the course,
we highly recommend it. Also, it says it should take ~25 hours to complete, but that includes
all of the paid content too, so expect it to take around 5-6 hours max.

### What are we going to be building?

Throughout this course, you'll have the opportunity (but you're not required) to build a project
we've designed. It's a social media website similar to a blog, think of something like Reddit,
with posts, comments, likes (we're calling them claps though), and a bit of other functionality.

If you have an idea of a project you want to try and make instead of ours, feel free to join us
and work on your project instead. Like it was said earlier, you're not required to make the 
project. If you do end up working on your own project, be aware that the materials we give out 
every week may not end up helping you as much as it would for our project, and you may encounter
issues and concepts we won't be covering, however, feel free to use us as a resource for fixing
and understanding them as they pop up.

### What technologies will I be learning?

During this time, we'll be teaching and providing demonstrations for a Java backend 
using a Vert.x framework and Typescript frontend using a React framework with a PostgreSQL 
database. The frontend

---

What we’ll be doing over this time is building out a single page application for a 
social networking site (think Reddit). We’ll be focusing on creating a Java/Vertx backend 
with a React/Redux frontend and some other dependencies on each to help out with some 
functionality. We’ll cover a lot of things like git/terminal commands, HTML/CSS/Javascript, 
the idea of a server, HTTP and REST requests, testing, databases, and cloud deployment. 
Don’t worry if some of that is unfamiliar to you, we’ll be sure to cover it at a fairly 
high level in our explanations and examples. 

This program is for anyone who is interested in learning about how a modern web 
application works, but it helps if you’ve written programs before. If you haven’t, or 
if you haven’t used Java, check out codecademy’s Java course, and it should teach you 
pretty much everything you’ll need to know about Java before we start. It will probably 
take a couple hours, but you can split it up over however long you need. And before we 
start the course, we’ll be adding you all to a Slack channel that you can use if you get 
stuck or have questions about anything. For those of you who may know Java and programming 
concepts pretty well, we also encourage you to try out our program if you’re interested 
and think there’s something you can learn from us. 

Every week, we’ll be building out the concepts taught. You’ll be given access to what 
we’re calling (for now at least) ‘catch-up code’, which is our implementation of the 
concepts, and which should show the progression of our app over time. This catch-up 
code is also to help out those of you who miss a meeting, are stuck trying to figure 
out what to do next, or have a busy week where you’re not able to do any work, but 
want to be prepared for the examples that will be shown in the next meeting. We will 
also be encouraging you to extend the application by implementing ideas for improvement 
that you come up with or things that we suggest but won’t end up covering in our 
examples. Also, if you decide that you want to take your project in a direction 
different from where we decide to take ours, or even want to work on your own idea, 
we’ll be here to help you work through issues and provide you with a lot of the concepts 
you’ll need to build it.
